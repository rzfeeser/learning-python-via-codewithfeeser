# Overview
Hey gang! Professor Feeser here. This repository contains code used in my **Learn Python** series on [YouTube - Code With Feeser - Learn Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxXenz9aOx0&list=PLBOVTVpIZJm1PZ6idZOaM63B54thob64n)


## Structure
This repository has a flat structure. Each script (`*.py`) is a stand alone Python script used for teaching purposes.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is a best practice repository I use for teaching structure and organization of playbooks. If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue. If you haven't already, be sure to watch the videos I have posted on using the content found in this repository [YouTube CodeWithFeeser - Learn Ansible - Deploy Docker Containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5ktStoJrU4)


## Helpful Notes
- Even if you are familiar with Python, the first few videos demonstrate how to get started with executing Python code within a GitHub codespace. They might be worth watching if GitHub Codespaces are new to you.
